   - Heatmaps: To identify correlations between various features like gender and purchase amount.
   - Pie Charts: Displayed the proportion of different product categories bought by customers.

### 4. Sales Insights:
   - Top Selling Product Categories: Identified the most popular product categories during Diwali sales.
   - High-Value Customers: Analyzed the group of customers contributing the most to the overall revenue, categorized by demographic information like age and gender.
